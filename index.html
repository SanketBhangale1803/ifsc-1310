          <p>
            You can add some information about spacex rockets and their future missions and all, that would be a nice add on.Plus the widget on almost every page is exactly the same except the contact window. You could have modified the content a little. The faqs tab is simple, it could have been more reponsive and playful by adding some JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>But overall it was a great/awesome attempt on the SpaceX one. Being the first individual project, you have done at par. We hope you will continue to improve and do such amazing projects in the future.</p>

      <h2>Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <div id="pro-en">
      <h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
      <p>
        Web design methodology that ensures that the content reaches all users first, regardless of their browser features and internet connection or simply digital advantage.
        <em><strong>"Graceful Degradation"</strong></em>: It's opposite to Progressive Enhancement. This is the way of developing in which content is first available to users who have advanced browser versions and then degrade to work well with older browser versions.
      </p>
      <h3>Core Principles Of Progressive Enhancement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All web browsers should be able to access basic content[global web standards]</li>
        <li>Basic functions and standard events should be available in all web browsers. It's important to use normal DOM before implementing custom events to handle advanced functionalities.</li>
        <li>All content should be contained in minimal,semantic markup.This enhances user-experience</li>
        <li>Externally connected JavaScript should provide enhanced functionality</li>
        <li>CSS that is externally connected should provide improved layout</li>
        <li>End-user web browser preferences should be respected. User should be able to use whichever browser they wish, and should not be compelled to use a certain browser in order to access website content</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why you should apply progressive enhancement to your web app?</h3>
      <p>When it comes to online content delivery, there are a variety of challenges that might arise that can be caused by either the user or the developer. Progressive enhancement is a solution that was created to mitigate the consequences of these issues, or at the very least provide the end-user with some, if not all, information.</p>
